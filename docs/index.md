## Abstract
The current software used to record measurements of transmembrane voltage provides plots, and a table of collected data, but does not provide all of the plots and data desired for measuring the selectivity of lysenin channels. Using the experimental data from a table, more data can be calculated and plotted to aid in measuring the selectivity of lysenin channels.
From the experimental data provided in a table, we have been able to calculate average voltages, standard deviation of voltages, concentration ratios, and permeability ratios and output all of these calculated values as columns of an output table. These new calculations have also allowed us to create a plot of voltages versus concentration ratios.
Since these calculations and plots can now be done automatically by our program, Dr.Fologea and his team will not have to spend time manually solving equations and plotting points. Our program allows more flexibility in the format of input and output since it can read and write to both excel, and csv file formats. Our program saves time and allows for customization of output tables.
